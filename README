Edit: A terminal-based text editor
==================================
This is a simple command-line text editor.
You can read files, edit them and save them to disk. That's all.
It's written in 100% standard C, without any 3rd party library.
For now, it only works on linux ;-)

Building and installing
=======================
1) clone the repo
   $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.saulv.es/edit.git
   $ cd edit
2) Run make
   $ make install
3) Edit
   $ edit my-file.txt file-number2.md

Keybindings
===========
- Ctrl + Q : Kill buffer
- Ctrl + K : Cut line
- Ctrl + S : Save buffer
- Ctrl + N : Add buffer
- Ctrl + F : Load file into buffer
- Ctrl + Left Arrow : Move to the buffer on the left
- Ctrl + Right Arrow : Move to the buffer on the right
- F5 : Reload file
- Ctrl + E : Execute command

Commands
========
- !quit : Exit the editor
- pwd : prints the current working directory
- strip [line|all]: Strips triling whitespaces
    strip line: same as "strip". Strips current line.
    strip buffer: strips all lines in the current buffer.
- goto <line-number>: jumps to a certain line
- search <string>: jumps to the next occurence of the given
		   string of text
- search-backwards: same as search, but backwards.

Arguments
=========
--exec <command>:
    Executes <command> for all the specified files.
    Example: edit --exec "strip buffer" file.c file2.c
             Will strip all trailing whitespaces from the files.
--:
    breaks the argument parsing. Treats the rest of the
    arguments as filenames.
    Example: edit -- -myfile.txt
             Treats "-myfile.txt" as a file to edit, instead
             of as an argument to parse.
