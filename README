Arguments
=========
--exec <command>:
    Executes <command> for all the specified files.
    Example: edit --exec "strip buffer" file.c file2.c
             Will strip all trailing whitespaces from the files.
--:
    breaks the argument parsing. Treats the rest of the
    arguments as filenames.
    Example: edit -- -myfile.txt
             Treats "-myfile.txt" as a file to edit, instead
             of as an argument to parse.
